# Web App Routes

This folder contains all the core **authenticated web application pages** that users interact with once logged in. It is organized as a route group `(webapp)` so it does not affect the URL structure.

## Purpose

- Centralizes all UI routes for the main app experience
- Keeps routes separate from public pages, marketing content, and API routes
- Improves maintainability and clarity in larger apps
