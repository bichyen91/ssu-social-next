# /app â€“ Application Routes and Layouts

This is a required directory in Next projects.

This directory contains the core structure of the application, organized using the **Next.js App Router**. All pages, layouts, templates, and route handlers are defined here using the file-based routing system introduced in Next.js 13+.

## Purpose

- Define the application's **page routes**, **layouts**, and **UI structure**
- Organize routes using nested folders and route groups
- Co-locate components, styles, and logic by route
