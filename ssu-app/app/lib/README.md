# /lib â€“ Shared Server-Side Logic

This directory contains **shared logic** used across the application, especially in route handlers, server components, and utilities. It is meant for **server-only code** such as database access, validation, and core business logic.

## Purpose

- Keep route handlers and components clean by separating logic
- Enable reusability across API routes, pages, and services
- Centralize critical logic like database queries, third-party integrations, and helper functions
