# API Routes

This directory contains all externally accessible **API endpoints** for the application. These are implemented using **Next.js route handlers** and follow the `/app/api/*` routing convention.

## Purpose

- Define backend endpoints for interacting with the app
- Handle requests such as authentication, form submissions, and data retrieval
- Expose routes to be used by the frontend or external clients
